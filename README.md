# Figure out Markdown and git locally.
I've installed the (insert link for https://vimawesome.com/plugin/instant-markdown-vim here)
from (insert link for VIM Awesome here -- )

 - need to download github **markdown** cheatsheet. 
 - as I look at this I am beginning to remember how this markup thing works. 
 - Perhaps I can get a vim snippets for github md...Hmmmm..
    - let me check.
.....

I've figured out a few things. still need to get a better workflow and folder structure. I want to start to use the github comments/error control also. 

*Lots to figure out out*

## May 6: 
 I've learned some things. Today I'm looking at the new 1.0 version of inkscape and the svg output. I've had issues in the past with their svg images being so bloated....it looks like they might have fixed some of those issues. 

 We'll see. 

 - Well, I did find out that if in my .vimrc file that when I set vim to run set number line and THEN set relative number lining you get a different presentation of the line numbers. How interesting. 
     ```
     set nu
     set rnu
     ```

# Things to figure out!
